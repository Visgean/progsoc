# Installing:

1. Download Python interpreter from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/). For Windows users select ``Windows x86-64 executable installer``, for Mac pick ``Mac OS X 64-bit/32-bit installer``.
**Please check the box asking you whether you'd like to add python to path.**

2. Secondly, install **Pycharm** from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
We recommend you install the professional version through your school email, so that you don't have to pay for anything. But if you dont want to register **you can use Comunity Edition** - for our purposes it won't make difference. 

# What are these tools?

Python is a popular programming language and Pycharm is powerful editor for editing Python files.
Think about Pycharm as a sort of Microsoft Word for programming. 

Python intepreter is a program that reads your Python files and tells computer what to do. This is necessary because computers itself work in very primitive programming language called Assembler. So think about this as a middleman between you and computer. 

# Playing with Python

Start Pycharm, it will ask you create a new project. Project in this context means simply a folder that contains your files. You can name it as you want. Then create a new file and put type following  (or copy it from here):

```python
print("Hello world.")
```
Then go to ``Run`` in Toolbar and select to run the file. It should look like this: 

![]({{ site.url }}/assets/l01/hello.png)

Congratulations, you just executed your first computer program.
