We created this page to help you keep track with content we cover during our sessions so that you are up to speed with everything. We hope you will make use of these notes and try to practice code they contain on your own, since only through practice one really gets the hang of things.


# Society

- This society serves as a platform for students with limited to no previous knowledge of coding to meet like-minded people and to learn how to code. 
- Your input is very much appreciated so if you have any thoughts as to how could we improve the content of our sessions, notes or anything, please let us know. :) 
- If you need clarification concerning topics covered, message us directly or post your query on the group's [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/314067608963415/).
