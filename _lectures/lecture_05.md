#Lecture 5, Week 7: Functions and revision
So in lecture 5 we mainly revised content from previous lectures and did a couple of exercises, some of which are posted below.
We recommend you to fill them in, try to have a go at them and if you struggle, just post your question on the FB group page or chat.
:) Good luck
