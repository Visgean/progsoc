##  Q1

Define a function called sum_of_x which contains only numbers which residuals while divided by 2 are zero, i.e. only even numbers.
Hint: In order to define a residual to be equal to zero, use 

```python
i%2 == 0
```
along with if and for statements, where appropriate. Also, do not forget about indentations.
