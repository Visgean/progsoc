A common situation is when you have been through the basics 
of programming language and you want to move to the next level.
There are lot of students who either went through some introductory 
course and did not continue with programming. This posts tries to 
show one possible path for such people.


## Learning by doing:

You will only learn programming by practising it, the answer of the header is simple: "Pick some project".
Now a lot of people say they can't really think of project, so below you will find projects for inspiration. 

1. Simple address book that uses json to save your addresses. See [json docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html).
2. Your own blog. See [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/).
3. Budget Tracker.


## Help with existing Open Source projects

There are many Open Source projects that are looking for beginners to help them out with implementing new features or fixing bugs.
Doing this will help you to learn about how programms are written in real-life and it will also provide you with much needed feedback.
You are unlikely to understand it all but that does not matter. You will likely need to learn how to work with ``git``, start with [this tutorial](https://try.github.io/).

## Daily programming exercises

There are many sites focusing on simple half an hour problems. These are great for practising your algorithmization skills and generally help you to remember programming. 
But rememember that real projects are more about the structure and collaborations and solving problems like these is only a portion of what you need to learn. Nevertheless we can recommend [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).
