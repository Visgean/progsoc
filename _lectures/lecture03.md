# If condition

For loops' are used to iterate (repeat) a certain function. 

```python
money = int(input('How much money???'))
if money > 20:
    print('lots of money')
if money > 100:
    print('woow so much money')
elif money == 4:
    print('you have 444 monies')
else:
    print('Not much you have young man')
    if money < 0:
            print('you have debts?')
```
